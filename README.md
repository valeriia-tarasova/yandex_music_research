# Research of user preferences of residents of Moscow and St. Petersburg in the Yandex.Music application
The aim of the study is to test three hypotheses:

1. User activity depends on the day of the week. Moreover, in Moscow and St. Petersburg this manifests itself in different ways.
2. On Monday morning, certain genres prevail in Moscow, while others prevail in St. Petersburg. Similarly, Friday evenings are dominated by different genres, depending on the city.
3. Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different genres of music. In Moscow, they listen to pop music more often, in St. Petersburg - Russian rap.
